## Why Building Blocks?

**The Problem** 🤔
Most Python applications start simple but become maintenance nightmares.

**The Solution** ✨
Building Blocks separates what your app does from how it does it.

---

## Overview

Building Blocks provides a foundation for implementing clean architecture patterns in Python applications. It is framework-agnostic and helps you build maintainable, testable, and scalable software following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and hexagonal architecture principles.
