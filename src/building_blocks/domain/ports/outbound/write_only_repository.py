    Write-only async repository interface for CQRS command scenarios.

    This interface is parameterized by the aggregate root type, providing
    type safety for command-side operations in CQRS architectures.

    Note: Write-only repositories typically don't need the ID type parameter
    since they work with aggregate instances that already contain their IDs.

    Perfect for:
    - CQRS command handlers that only need to persist changes
    - Event sourcing scenarios where writes go to event stores
    - Command-side databases optimized for writes
    - Enforcing write-only access in command contexts
