class Command(Message):
    """
    Base class for all domain commands.

    Commands represent an intent to do something in the domain.
    They are requests that may succeed or fail, and they are handled by command handler.

    Commands are named in imperative mood (e.g., CreateOrder, RegisterCustomer,
    ProcessPayment).

    Example:
        >>> class CreateOrder(Command):
        ...     def __init__(
        ...         self,
        ...         customer_id: str,
        ...         items: list,
        ...         metadata: Optional[MessageMetadata] = None
        ...     ):
        ...         super().__init__(metadata)
        ...         self._customer_id = customer_id
        ...         self._items = items
        ...
        ...     @property
        ...     def customer_id(self) -> str:
        ...         return self._customer_id

        ...         return self._items
        ...
        ...     @property
        ...     def payload(self) -> dict[str, Any]:
        ...         return {
        ...             "customer_id": self._customer_id,
        ...             "items": self._items
